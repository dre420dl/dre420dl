An intelligent, mobile-first arbitrage decision engine designed for the 2026 Web3 ecosystem. It monitors price spreads across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) while factoring in real-time network congestion.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Gas-Aware Profitability:** Dynamically fetches Gwei prices to calculate "True Net" profit (Gross - Gas - Slippage).
- **Multi-Token Scanner:** Simultaneous monitoring for ETH, LINK, and WBTC.
- **Silent Sentry:** Background fetch tasks that notify you of opportunities even when the app is closed.
- **Paper Trading Mode:** A risk-free simulation environment with persistent virtual balance tracking.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
- **Data:** CoinGecko & Etherscan APIs
- **Logic:** BackgroundFetch & TaskManager for persistent monitoring
- **Visualization:** `react-native-chart-kit` for performance tracking
